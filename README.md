# Graphically Graphic

Graphically graphic is a hub for all the nedds of a graphic designer looking to acquire freelance work and house all requests from clients. The site groups together the needs to communicate with customers looking for work to be completed with the needs to showcase impressive previous works in order to let viewers know they are in the right place. Equally as a user looking to get work done, the ssite allows you to see feedback on previous jobs completed, get a quote for the work you're requesting and sign in to see your requests active whilst monitoring their proggress as updated by the admin. 

 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

**************************
    * As a potential client, I want to be able to log in so that my interactions with the site can be saved for future reference

    * As a potential client, I want to be able to see the previous work of the designer so that I may decide if they are right for me

    * As a potential client, I want to be able to make a request to the designer to complete work for me

    * As a potential client, I want to be able to know how much a job will cost so that I can judge if I am willing to pay

    * As a potential client, I want to be able to see the progress made on my requests so that I can be reassured of it's completion


    * As an admin, I want to be the only one able to see requests made to me by potential clients so that I may accept or decline them.

    * As an admin, I want to be able to easily contact potential clients so that I may discuss their requests with them.

    * As an admin I want to be able to add completed work to my site with feedback so that future viewers may be more interested in commissioning my work.


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

- Login system, is a function of logging into a session as a user or as an admin with different site 

- Payment system - allows users to put down a deposit for the work they would like to be completed, once a fee has been agreed and allows users to pay for completed work.

- Form to submit requests, with calculated quote and time frame 
- Gallery of previous work with details included incl - timeframe, cost, spec details and feedback, image, client(anon or listed).
- As Admin, view current requests in priority order (With status = Accepted, Declined, awaiting deposit, deposit recieved, in progress, completed, awaiting payment, paid)
- Chat with client concerning work requested - linked to work request
- As client - see requests past, current.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z

- Login system, as admin or as user - allows both users and admins to log in to the site and see requests you've created and your quote and as admin allows you to see all requests made to you and update their progress

- Payment system - allows users to put down a deposit for the work they would like to be completed, once a fee has been agreed and allows users to pay for completed work.


For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
